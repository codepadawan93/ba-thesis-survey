They are among the best known and most quality thermal spas in the country. B?ile Felix is also at a close distance to Oradea, a major city in western Romania. Thermal springs were valued in the eighteenth century by the monk Felix Helcher of the Monastery of Klosterbruck (de) in Moravia, administrator of the Sanmartin monastery. Between 1711-1721 the first treatment facilities were organized under the name of Baia lui Felix (in HungarianF?lixf?rd?). Felix Helcher died in 1737.[1] In 1885 a new spring, with a temperature of 49 ? C, was found. The thermal springs were discovered in around 1000, or in around 1200, or according to other experts, only in 1700. The only fact agreed by all experts is the appearance of the first buildings in this resort: between the years 1711 - 1721. In 1948 Sanmartin monastery area was nationalized by the communist authorities. Several recreational bases, including the one belonged to Securitate, were built on the nationalized land. The Premonstatens Order claims it latter. On April 2, 2014, the HCCJ (Higher Court of Cassation and Justice) ordered the transfer of the filed case from Oradea Court to the Giurgiu District Court, where it is now.[2] Other requests of the Premonstratens Order on retrocession the B?ile Felix lands are in progress at HCCJ.","Bihor",46.55402,22.56929,0
